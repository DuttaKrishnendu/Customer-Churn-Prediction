# Customer Churn Prediction üìä

This project is an interactive web application that predicts customer churn using a machine learning model. Users can input customer details through a simple web interface, and the application provides a real-time prediction of whether the customer is likely to churn or not. The app is built with Python and deployed using Streamlit.
